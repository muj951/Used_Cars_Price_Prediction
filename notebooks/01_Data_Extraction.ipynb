    "# Phase 1: Data Extraction Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Objective\n",
    "To build a robust Machine Learning model, I needed real-world, current market data. Standard datasets (like Kaggle) are often outdated. Therefore, I built a custom web scraper to target eBay's used car listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. The Strategy\n",
    "I utilized Python's scraping ecosystem to iterate through search result pages and extract granular details for each listing.\n",
    "* **Target:** Used Car Listings\n",
    "* **Technique:** \"Download First, Parse Later.\" I saved the raw HTML locally first. This allowed me to experiment with different parsing logic without needing to re-request (and potentially get blocked by) the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Extraction Points\n",
    "For every car listing, I successfully extracted the following raw attributes:\n",
    "* **Title:** (e.g., \"2015 BMW 5-Series 80k miles\") - *Critical for extracting Year/Make/Model.*\n",
    "* **Price:** The target variable for predictions.\n",
    "* **Mileage:** A key depreciation factor.\n",
    "* **Seller Info:** Ratings and review counts (to analyze seller reliability).\n",
    "* **Listing Type:** Auction vs. Buy It Now (Can be used in pricing logic later).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Challenges & Solutions\n",
    "* **Anti-Scraping Logic:** The website flagged high-frequency requests. I solved this by implementing random time delays (`time.sleep`) and manually handling CAPTCHA interruptions when necessary.\n",
    "* **Inconsistent Formatting:** Prices appeared as \"$10,000\" or \"10000\". I wrote helper functions to standardize these into pure integers immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcome\n",
    "I successfully scraped and saved a raw dataset (`ebay_cars_raw.csv`) containing **~4,600 unique rows**. This raw data is now ready for the **Database Integration** phase."
